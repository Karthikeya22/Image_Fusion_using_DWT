# Image_Fusion_using_DWT

The method of incorporating data from numerous images of the same view is referred to as image fusion. These images might have been congregated using numerous cameras, at separate times, and with varying spatial and spectral attributes. Conserving every image's respective finest compelling qualities is one of the main goals of the process of image fusion. With recent considerable scientific advancements, developments and breakthroughs at this day and age, it is now feasible to assemble data from numerous origin images just for the sheer motive of producing a superior class fused image that contains spatial and spectral data. Some noteworthy applications of the process of image fusion are Remote imaging, Medical modeling and  microscopic vision. Pixel averaging is the classic fusion procedure. However, higher convoluted techniques like Wavelet transform fusion and Principal component analysis are also achievable.

<h2> Datset </h2>
In the field of computational photography, multi-focus image fusion (MFF) is a critical task. Current approaches have yielded considerable gains in performance. This Image Fusion study used a Multi-Focus Image dataset with a total of nine pairs of standard quality photos. The registered pictures were evaluated for the fusion procedure in this study because successful image fusion requires that the images be accurately aligned on a pixel-by-pixel basis. The suggested ideas of the process are performed on the images present in the dataset provided.
